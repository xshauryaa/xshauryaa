# 👋 Hey, I'm Shaurya

I'm a **Computer Science & Cognitive Systems student at UBC** and a **CS Teaching Assistant**, focused on building **production-grade systems** at the intersection of **software engineering, AI, and human-centered design**.

I enjoy designing clean abstractions, reasoning about system tradeoffs, and shipping products that real users rely on.

## 🚀 Currently Building

### 🗓️ Plannr — AI-Powered Smart Scheduling
**Founder | React Native · FastAPI · PostgreSQL · GenAI**

- Designed a **dependency-aware scheduling engine** using DAGs and topological sorting  
- Implemented multiple scheduling strategies (earliest-fit, balanced-work, deadline-oriented)
- Built real-time rescheduling + ICS export
- 70+ users onboarded for beta testing
- Currently integrating an **AI scheduling assistant** (RAG + agents)

🔗 Repo: coming soon

### 💸 WealthWise — AI Personal Finance Companion
**React Native · FastAPI · PyTorch · RAG**

- Built a **RAG-powered financial advisor** using transaction data via Plaid
- Designed bite-sized, Duolingo-style financial education modules
- Focused on explainability, trust, and user learning
- 40+ beta users through UBC BizTech KickStart
